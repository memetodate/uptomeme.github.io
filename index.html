    <h1> Up-To-Meme is a meme card-hybrid-online game to play with your friends.</h1>
    <h3> Always the freshest,spiciest, most up-to-date memes and captions.</h3>
    <h2>1. Why are you making this?</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to keep meme card games up-to-date without having to purchase another copy.</p>
    <h2>2. How?</h2>
    <p> Our cards will only have urls and qr codes to those URLs.</p>
    <h2>3. Why would you make it hard to use offline? Is there any way to use them offline?</h2>
    <p> Not sure on the first question. 2nd question: I am thinking of a backup kit with memes from the time.</p>
    <h2>4. Would this lead towards loss of card game ownership, monthly subscription card games, online ad-supported physical card games,and online physical card game DRM?</h2>
    <p> I am sorry to say this: while I do not intend to do those things here, someone else might do them later down the line. </p>
    <h2>5. Are you integrating anything else in the future?</h2>
    <p> someday, there will be an online version that is always up-to-date and has meme points!</p>
    <h2>6. Will you regret this someday?</h2>
    <p> Refer to 4. If either one of those situations happen, I will be so regretful that some of the cards will have stuff advising against those situations.</p>
    <h2>Is this going to be open source?</h2>
    <p>yes</p>
